## Sailfish OS building instructions
To build Fuoten for Sailfish OS, you need the [Sailfish OS Application SDK](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Application_SDK).

At first you have to clone this repository including all submodules (libfuoten, BT SFOS Components).

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Buschtrommel/Fuoten.git
    
Now open the *Fuoten.pro* project file in the SDK and configure your build targets. For every build target
you have to specify the following additional *qmake arguments* (can be done on the Projects page of the Qt Creator).

    CONFIG+=sfos CONFIG+=no_install_dev_files INSTALL_LIB_DIR=/usr/share/harbour-fuoten/lib INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS_DIR=/usr/share/harbour-fuoten/l10n
    
To create the translations, run the following script inside the Fuoten repository base directory:

    ./releasel10n.sh
    
Now you are ready to build and run Fuoten on your Sailfish OS device or in the emulator.
